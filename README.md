## Getting Started
To build this app:
1. set up a repo containing a server.js file, a .env file, a data folder containing the necessary JSON, and a .gitignore file.
2. Initialize npm then install dotenv and express.
3. Set up the server.js file so that it requires express and dotenv, and uses the .env file to hide the PORT value.
