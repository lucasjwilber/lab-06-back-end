# lab-06-back-end


**Authors** Lucas Wilber/Rachel Rice
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This app aims to use several API calls to return location data for an inputted location. It uses Google geocode, yelp, themoviedb, eventbrite, and darksky APIs.

## Getting Started
To build this app:
1. set up a repo containing a server.js file, a .env file, a data folder containing the necessary JSON, and a .gitignore file.
2. Initialize npm then install dotenv and express.
3. Set up the server.js file so that it requires express and dotenv, and uses the .env file to hide the PORT value.
4. Create routes that use constructor functions to parse the data and return what you're looking for from the API.
5. Use try/catch to handle errors and return error messages.

## Architecture
This app uses Google geocode, yelp, themoviedb, eventbrite, and darksky APIs. It uses jQuery on the front end and express on the back end. It also uses dotenv and cors.
